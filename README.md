### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patrycja and I'm starting my journey in Front-End development.
<br><br>
Currently working as a logistician... Guys, the job is so boring, that I had to find a hobby which will save my sanity... :woman_facepalming::brain:
<br>That's how I started programming :)
<br><br>Kind of a nerd. Interested in computers and technology :computer_mouse:
<br>In love with science - especially physics and astronomy :ringed_planet::artificial_satellite::telescope:
<br>Music addict :headphones: 
<br><br>Programming in my free time :woman_technologist:
